Task 2 – Electronic Engineering
This project demonstrates how to control three LEDs using three push buttons with an Arduino UNO. When a button is pressed, the corresponding LED lights up.
Components Used
• - Arduino UNO board
• - Breadboard
• - 3 × Push Buttons
• - 3 × LEDs (any color)
• - 3 × Resistors (220Ω – 330Ω for LEDs)
• - Jumper wires
Circuit Connections
Each button is connected to a digital input pin and the LEDs are connected to digital output pins. Internal pull-down resistors or external ones can be used if necessary.
